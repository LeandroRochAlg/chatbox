# Chatbox

Notes
- This is a chatbox made for Streamlabs in scales of gray.
  - You can use both, light or dark mode only changing where the comments are at the top of the chat.css code.
  - You can even use other colours you want.
    - Because the chatbox was made for black & white, emotes and badges have a grayscale filter. You are able to remove it if you want to.

Thanks for passing by!!!
